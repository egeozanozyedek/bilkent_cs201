 removeFilm function
 An index varibale is created and is set to an unreachable index (-1) for checking whether the film exists in films or not
 If it exists then the index is set to be the index i of the film in the films array
 Otherwise return 0
 Create a film pointer called temp which points to the same location as films
 If noOfFilms - 1 < size/2 then the size of the array is halved and a new space is allocated
 Deep copy, when i = index the program does not copy which means the movie is removed
 Reduce the noOfFilms
 If films points to the same location as temp, do not delete temp. If films points to a newly allocated location, delete temp. (I did this for cleaner code, there are other ways of implementing this such as not creating temp for the case of noOfFilms - 1 > size/2 but for less lines i decided to create temp and check for where the two pointers were pointing to at the end. The code should work.)
